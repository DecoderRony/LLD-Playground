🧠 Low-Level Design Playground

Welcome to my LLD Laboratory – where I battle dragons (a.k.a. design patterns), wrestle with abstractions, and occasionally win against my own laziness 🐢💥.

This repo is a glorious collection of my practice LLD codes – built with pain, persistence, and just enough caffeine to power a small planet ☕🌍.

It's my way of:

    Revising design principles 💡

    Keeping track of struggles overcome (bye bye, procrastination 👋)

    And, of course, flexing that I actually did some work 😎

    “One design at a time, I'm turning confusion into clarity – or at least more organized confusion!”
